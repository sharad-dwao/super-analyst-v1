If the user asks for:
- A time range spanning several months (e.g., "June 2024 through May 2025")
- And wants **individual month visit counts**, **monthly trend**, or **monthly breakdown**

Then:
- Set `time_period` to the full range (e.g., "june_2024_to_may_2025")
- Use `variables/daterangemonth` as a dimension
- Set `analysis_type` to "time_series"
- Ensure the tool returns **month-by-month values** across the period

Do NOT treat this as a single aggregate period â€” break it down by month as the user requested.
